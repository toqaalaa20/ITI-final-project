# Outer Space Prediction Model Documentation

## Documentation

### Model description
The Outer Space Prediction Model is a supervised machine learning model that takes the relative velocity and distance of a body mass in outer space and predicts whether it is hazardous or not based on a Logistic Regression algorithm.

### Usage

#### Installation
Install dependencies in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inputs and Outputs

#### Inputs

The model takes the following inputs:

- Relative Velocity: Velocity of mass body in kmph.
- Distance: Distance of mass body from Earth in km.

#### Outputs
The model produces the following output:

- Predicted Output: Whether the mass body is hazardous to Earth or not.
